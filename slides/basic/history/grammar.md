Escribe en tiempo presente.

<small class="fragment">Los commits deben sonar como instrucciones o t√≠tulos de tareas.</small>

Note:

-   imperative mood - as if you are telling someone to do something
-   present tense, as if you are currently doing the change
-   **this makes short messages**, but does sound rude at first
