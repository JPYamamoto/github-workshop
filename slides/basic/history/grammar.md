Escribe en tiempo presente, modo imperativo

<small class="fragment">Los commits deben sonar como comandos/instrucciones</small>

Note:
- imperative mood - as if you are telling someone to do something
- present tense, as if you are currently doing the change
- **this makes short messages**, but does sound rude at first
